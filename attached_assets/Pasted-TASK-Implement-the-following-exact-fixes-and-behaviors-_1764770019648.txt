TASK: Implement the following exact fixes and behaviors in the React project (apply only these changes):

1) After user selects a size and clicks "Add to Cart", the **quantity input for that size must reset to 0** immediately.  
   - Example: If user sets S = 2 and clicks Add (adds 2 S), then selects M = 2 and clicks Add, final cart should be S=2 and M=2. Quantities must not accumulate incorrectly across size selections.

2) Wholesale pricing tags on the product page currently behave like interactive buttons on hover.  
   - Change them to **non-interactive static tags** (no hover/state change, not clickable).  
   - All wholesale tags (1-5, 6-25, 26+) must use identical static styling.

3) Restructure `textData.json` (language / product data):  
   - For each product use a single product key (e.g., `P1`) containing **all fields** for that product: `title`, `description`, `sku`, `wholesalePricing` (tiers), `color`, `sizeMeasurements`, `imagePaths` (references to assets), `minOrder`, `specifications`, etc.  
   - Every product-related string or asset reference must be nested under its product key. Do not scatter product fields across multiple unrelated keys.  
   - Ensure matching image filenames in `assets/` and references in `textData.json` follow a clear naming convention (e.g., `P1-1.jpg`, `P1-2.jpg`, ...).

4) Product gallery behavior inside product page:  
   - Under the main image show at least **4 small thumbnail images** (relative size smaller than main).  
   - Clicking a thumbnail replaces the main image.  
   - Also show left/right arrow buttons centered vertically on the main image (small, visible) to navigate images. Thumbnails and arrows must update the main image accordingly.

5) Catalog grid image navigation:  
   - Add **small round left/right arrows** centered vertically on each product box in the catalog grid so the user can view the other product images **without entering the product page**.  
   - These arrows should be visible and navigate between that product's images in-place (and not require swipe).

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (strict):  
- Do not change any other behavior except as required above.  
- Keep accessibility: arrows and thumbnails keyboard-focusable.  
- Ensure image filename naming in `assets/` matches product keys in `textData.json`.  
- Resetting quantity must work for all variants/sizes and not affect other items in cart.
