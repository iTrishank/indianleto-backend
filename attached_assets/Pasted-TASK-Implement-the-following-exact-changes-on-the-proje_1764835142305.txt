TASK: Implement the following exact changes on the project:

1) Catalog layout / stretching:
   - On the catalog screen make the product grid layout visually stretched to use the maximum available width inside the main container.
   - Show products so they appear "stretched max" and display a summary like "Showing 6 of 6" (or "Showing X of Y") above the grid up until the Clear Filter button (i.e., the summary stays visible until filters are applied).
   - Ensure the grid and summary align properly with the Clear Filter button and the rest of the header area.

2) Per-size minimum order (data + UI behavior):
   - Each product size must have its own `minOrder` value stored in `textData.json` under that product's key (e.g., `P1.sizeMinOrders = { "S": 2, "M": 4, "L": 3 }`).
   - When a user clicks/selects a size on the product page, the UI must immediately use that size's `minOrder` value (update the quantity control and any validation accordingly).
   - The `textData.json` must be structured so size-specific `minOrder` values are easy to edit in the future.

3) Shorten the big gradient section:
   - Reduce the vertical length of the section with `className="relative bg-gradient-to-r from-primary/10 via-primary/5 to-background py-10 md:py-12"`.
   - Remove excessive empty whitespace so the section is compact and visually balanced while keeping the gradient look.

4) Cart animation when adding product:
   - Replace the current add-to-cart animation with a cleaner, seamless animation where the small numeric badge is proportional and does not overlap or appear larger than product cards.
   - Make the animation subtle and smooth (no sudden jumps). The cart count square should remain visually smaller than the product card and aligned neatly in the header.

5) Product card min-order tag:
   - On each product card add a small tag at the **top-right corner** showing the minimum order for the small size only (label: `Min: <number>` or similar).
   - The tag should be unobtrusive, consistent across cards, and follow existing styling (small font, rounded background).

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (strict):
- Do only these changes; do not alter unrelated behavior.
- Keep accessibility: tags and animations keyboard-focusable or non-interfering.
- Ensure `textData.json` is updated and the data structure matches the product keys and asset naming conventions already used.
- Make layout changes responsive and consistent with existing container rules.
