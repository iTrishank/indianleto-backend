got it, trishank — here’s a clean copy-paste prompt for Replit AI that contains **only** what you just wrote, nothing else. Use it as-is.

```
TASK: Implement the following exact UI/behavior changes:

1) Grid behavior:
   - Modify the container with `className="grid gap-3 sm:gap-4 lg:gap-5"` so product cards always occupy available empty space.
   - Cards must remain square. You may change the card dimensions per breakpoint (desktop/tablet/mobile) but **do not** make card size dynamic based on flow; use fixed sizes per breakpoint.
   - If there is empty space at the end of a row, increase the card dimension (within breakpoint limits) so cards fill the row and no empty gaps remain. If gaps appear between cards, increase card size (keeping square) to eliminate interior gaps.
   - Goal: the grid must not show empty space at the end or large gaps between cards — cards should visually fill the container.

2) Mobile view changes:
   a) Remove the left/right arrow controls on product pictures in mobile catalog/product gallery. Mobile users will tap the thumbnail or the image they want to view.
   b) Arrange wholesale pricing tags horizontally in a single row on mobile (not vertical), so they consume less vertical space.
   c) Remove the slide-in side filter panel on mobile. Place the filters inline on the catalog screen (same filters as desktop, working the same as laptop view). There are only two filters, so inline placement is fine.

3) Cart notification / badge:
   - Move the add-to-cart notification/identifier/alert (the small numeric indicator that shows when an item is added) to display **on the product card itself** rather than far left by the cart icon.
   - The notification on the card should show the updated number briefly and be visually integrated with the card (not obstructing product image), then disappear or remain as a subtle persisted indicator as currently intended.

4) Loading state on navigation:
   - When changing language or currency, and when navigating from catalog to product page, show the same loading spinner UI (black-and-white spinner used for filters) until the page content has fully updated.
   - Ensure language/currency change triggers the spinner and the UI does not flicker; spinner must display during the change and stop when content is stable.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (strict):
- Keep cards square at all breakpoints.
- Do not add or remove filters — only change their placement on mobile.
- Preserve accessibility: all touch targets remain reachable and keyboard-focusable where applicable.
- Make layout changes responsive and consistent with the main container alignment rules already used in the project.
