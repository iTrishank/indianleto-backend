TASK: Fix the PREVIOUS implementation. Only do the following:

1) THEME COLOR → PURE BLACK (NO PINK ANYWHERE)
   - Set the global theme color to pure black: rgb(0, 0, 0).
   - Go through ALL places where the old pink theme is still used and replace it with black:
     • Tailwind classes like text-primary, bg-primary, border-primary, hover:bg-primary, etc.
     • Any custom pink hex codes (for example: #ec4899, #f472b6, #f9e5f1, or similar).
     • Buttons, badges, active states, underlines, filter tags, etc.
   - After this change there must be **no pink UI elements** left. All “primary” accents must use black or grayscale.

2) MINIMUM ORDER VALIDATION (BOTH BUTTONS)
   - The logic for enabling/disabling must be **shared** between:
     • “Add to Quote” (on product page)
     • “Submit Quotation Request” (in Your Quotation)
   - RULE:
     • Let minOrderPerSize[S], minOrderPerSize[M], etc. come from data.
     • Compute: isValid = at least ONE size has quantity >= its minOrder.
     • If isValid === false:
         - Disable BOTH buttons: Add to Quote AND Submit Quotation Request.
         - Show a clear warning message near the controls:
           “Please meet the minimum order requirement before continuing.”
     • If isValid === true:
         - Enable BOTH buttons.
   - Fix the current bug where “Submit Quotation Request” is still active even when all sizes are below their minimum.

3) MOBILE NAVBAR FOR “CATALOG | ABOUT US”
   - REMOVE the extra mobile wrapper like:
       className="sm:hidden sticky top-14 z-40 w-full bg-background py-2"
     or any similar extra div just for that bar.
   - Instead, on mobile ONLY, render a simple centered nav element:
       <nav className="inline-flex items-center gap-4 px-5 py-1.5 rounded-full border border-border bg-background">
         Catalog | About Us
       </nav>
   - This nav should:
     • Be centered horizontally.
     • Not be sticky separately at top-14.
     • Not add extra bars; just use this one compact pill-style nav.
   - Desktop / full view must remain unchanged.

DO NOT touch anything else. Only fix these three points.
