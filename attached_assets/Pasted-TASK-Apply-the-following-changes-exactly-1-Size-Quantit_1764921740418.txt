TASK: Apply the following changes exactly:

1) Size & Quantity alignment:
   - Push Size label to the far left.
   - Push quantity selector + shortcut buttons to the far right (same row).
   
2) Navbar theme color:
   - Remove the theme color selector completely.
   - Set website primary color to pure black: rgb(0, 0, 0).

3) Cart badge layout shift:
   - Add extra right-side spacing around the cart icon so the badge can appear without shifting navbar items.
   - Badge must overlay cleanly without moving anything.

4) Image loading performance:
   - Keep the current folder structure (`assets/P1/1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, etc.) but optimize loading.
   - Use one or more of:
       • browser caching  
       • lazy loading  
       • Next-gen formats (webp) if possible  
       • preloading hero/product images  
   - Goal: eliminate the slow-loading delay.

5) Skeleton screens:
   - Add skeleton placeholders across the entire site wherever images load (catalog, product page, thumbnails, etc.).

6) Navbar links:
   - Center “Catalog | About Us” in the navbar.
   - Style them bold and black.

7) Typography — apply full-site industry-standard typography rules:
   - Use a consistent typography scale (e.g., 1.200 modular scale).
   - Heading hierarchy:
        H1: 32–40px  
        H2: 24–28px  
        H3: 20–22px  
        Body: 16–18px  
   - Line-height guidelines:
        Headings: 1.2–1.3  
        Body text: 1.45–1.6  
   - Font-weight rules:
        Headings: 600–700  
        Body: 400–500  
        Labels/UI elements: 500  
   - Set consistent letter spacing:
        Headings: normal  
        Body: slight (-0.2px to 0px)  
   - Paragraph spacing:
        Uniform margin-bottom (12–16px).  
   - Buttons:
        All buttons share the same type scale, weight, and letter spacing.
   - Inputs & Labels:
        Labels 14–16px, slightly bold; inputs 16px consistent across all pages.
   - Product cards:
        SKU, MOQ, and pricing typography consistent across catalog and product page.
   - Mobile rules:
        Reduce font sizes ~10–15% but preserve hierarchy.
   - Overall goal:
        A fully unified, predictable, and clean typography system across the whole website.

8) Loading state behavior:
   - Navigating from catalog → product must trigger the same loading spinner.
   - Loading must stay active until content is fully ready.
   - If loading exceeds 5 seconds, show an error popup and keep the user on the previous page.

9) Quotation section (mobile only):
   - Layout should be:
       for eg A1 : [ (image, name) on ONE line   
        Under name → (size, color)  ] 
        Under A1 → quantity selector  on the left and  unit price + total  on the right
      
   - Make the structure compact and readable.

10) Mobile navbar rework:
    - “Catalog | About Us” is not visible on mobile.
    - Keep main navbar clean; add a **second navbar below it (mobile only)** that contains Catalog | About Us.

11) Mobile filters layout:
    - Put Filters & Clear Filter on the same row.
    - Adjust widths so both fit side-by-side.

12) Footer height:
    - Reduce height of “© 2025 IndianLeto…” to minimum so only the text is visible.
    - Remove unnecessary vertical padding.

Implement ONLY these changes.
